# FairShare Expense Sharing App

A modern expense sharing application designed for two users to track and split expenses, built with React, TypeScript, and Firebase.

## Features

- üîê Google Authentication
- üí∞ Track and categorize expenses
- üìä Visualize spending patterns with charts
- üîÑ Split expenses equally (50/50) or assign to one user (100%)
- üì± Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- üìÜ Monthly expense tracking and settlement

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **State Management**: React Context + React Query for server state
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
- **Routing**: React Router v7

### Core Architecture Concepts

#### Two-User System
The application is designed specifically for two users to share expenses:
- Simplified user management
- Split types limited to 50/50 or 100%
- Straightforward settlement calculations

#### Component Architecture
- **Container/Presentation Pattern**: Separates data fetching from UI rendering
- **Lazy Loading**: Improves initial load time with component code splitting
- **Memo & Optimization**: Performance optimized for larger datasets

#### Data Flow
- **Context Providers**: Domain-specific contexts (User, Resources)
- **Custom Hooks**: Abstracted data fetching and state management
- **Service Layer**: Firebase operations abstracted through service modules

#### Type System
- Centralized type definitions in shared directory
- Consistent use of TypeScript interfaces
- Strong typing throughout the application

## Scripts & Automation

This project uses a unified GitHub Actions workflow for deploying to both staging and production environments using npm and Firebase Hosting.

### Deployment Workflow

- **Unified Workflow:**
  - The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow handles both staging and production deployments.
  - **Push to `staging` branch:** Deploys to the staging Firebase project (`aafairshare---staging`).
  - **Push to `main` branch:** Deploys to the production Firebase project (`aafairshare`).
  - The workflow uses npm for dependency management and build, and conditionally deploys based on the branch.

#### How to Deploy
- **To test in staging:**
  1. Push or merge your changes to the `staging` branch.
  2. The workflow will build and deploy to the staging Firebase environment.
- **To deploy to production:**
  1. Merge or cherry-pick your changes to the `main` branch.
  2. The workflow will build and deploy to the production Firebase environment.

#### Example Workflow File
See `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for the full configuration.

### Other Scripts

- **sync-monthly-data.ts**
  - **What it does:** Syncs Firestore data for a given month (categories, locations, expenses, settlements) from production to staging.
  - **How to run:**
    ```sh
    npm tsx scripts/sync-monthly-data.ts --month YYYY-MM [--dry-run]
    ```
    Add `--dry-run` to preview changes without writing.

- **migrate-firebase-data.js**
  - **What it does:** Migrates all users and collections from production to staging, including backup to disk.
  - **How to run:**
    ```sh
    node scripts/migrate-firebase-data.js
    ```

- **fix-expense-dates.ts**
  - **What it does:** Fixes expenses in Firestore where the `date` field was incorrectly migrated (e.g., from Timestamp to map object). Runs against STAGING.
  - **How to run:**
    ```sh
    npm tsx scripts/fix-expense-dates.ts
    ```
