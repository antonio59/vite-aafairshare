# FairShare Expense Sharing App

A modern expense sharing application designed for two users to track and split expenses, built with React, TypeScript, and Firebase.

## Features

- 🔐 Google Authentication
- 💰 Track and categorize expenses
- 📊 Visualize spending patterns with charts
- 🔄 Split expenses equally (50/50) or assign to one user (100%)
- 📱 Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- 📆 Monthly expense tracking and settlement

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **State Management**: React Context + React Query for server state
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Backend**: Firebase (Firestore, Authentication)
- **Routing**: React Router v7

### Core Architecture Concepts

#### Two-User System
The application is designed specifically for two users to share expenses:
- Simplified user management
- Split types limited to 50/50 or 100%
- Straightforward settlement calculations

#### Component Architecture
- **Container/Presentation Pattern**: Separates data fetching from UI rendering
- **Lazy Loading**: Improves initial load time with component code splitting
- **Memo & Optimization**: Performance optimized for larger datasets

#### Data Flow
- **Context Providers**: Domain-specific contexts (User, Resources)
- **Custom Hooks**: Abstracted data fetching and state management
- **Service Layer**: Firebase operations abstracted through service modules

#### Type System
- Centralized type definitions in shared directory
- Consistent use of TypeScript interfaces
- Strong typing throughout the application

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- Firebase account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fairshare.git
cd fairshare
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase configuration:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

4. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Recommended Package Manager: pnpm

This project is tested and works best with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Using pnpm avoids issues with optional native dependencies (such as Rollup on Apple Silicon) that can occur with npm.

### Install pnpm

If you don't have pnpm installed, run:

```sh
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Build for Staging

```sh
pnpm run build:staging
```

### Deploy to Firebase Hosting (Staging)

```sh
firebase deploy --only hosting --project staging
```

### Notes
- If you previously used npm or yarn, remove `node_modules` and lockfiles before switching to pnpm:
  ```sh
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock pnpm-lock.yaml
  ```
- pnpm will generate its own `pnpm-lock.yaml` file.
- All npm scripts work the same way with pnpm (e.g., `pnpm run dev`, `pnpm run build`, etc.).
