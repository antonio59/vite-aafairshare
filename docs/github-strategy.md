# GitHub and Deployment Strategy

## Branch Strategy

We follow a modified Git Flow approach:

- `main` - Production branch, deployed to production environment
- `develop` - Staging branch, deployed to staging environment
- `feature/*` - Feature branches, created from `develop`
- `hotfix/*` - Hotfix branches, created from `main`
- `release/*` - Release branches, created from `develop` when preparing for production

## Workflow

1. Development work happens on `feature/*` branches
2. Feature branches are merged into `develop` via PR
3. `develop` is automatically deployed to staging
4. When ready for production, create a `release/*` branch
5. Final QA happens on the release branch
6. Release branch is merged to `main` via PR
7. `main` is automatically deployed to production
8. `main` is merged back into `develop` to sync changes

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Workflows

- **Pull Request Validation**: Runs on all PRs to validate code quality
- **Staging Deployment**: Runs on pushes to `develop` and deploys to staging
- **Production Deployment**: Runs on pushes to `main` and deploys to production

### Environment Setup

**Staging Environment**:
- Firebase project: `aafairshare-staging`
- Custom domain: `staging.aafairshare.com`
- Feature flags enabled for testing

**Production Environment**:
- Firebase project: `aafairshare-prod`
- Custom domain: `aafairshare.com`
- Strict security rules

## Version Management

- Dependencies are locked in package.json with exact versions
- Major dependency updates require dedicated PRs and testing
- Semantic versioning for application releases (vX.Y.Z)
  - X: Major version (breaking changes)
  - Y: Minor version (new features)
  - Z: Patch version (bug fixes)

## Secrets Management

GitHub Secrets are used to store:
- Firebase service account keys
- API keys
- Environment-specific configuration

## Deployment Process

Each deployment includes:
- Build process with environment-specific variables
- Firebase Hosting deployment
- Firestore Rules deployment
- Storage Rules deployment
- GitHub Release creation (for production)
- Slack notifications

## Rollback Strategy

1. In case of deployment issues, use Firebase Hosting's rollback feature
2. For database issues, restore from the latest backup
3. Create a hotfix branch from `main` for emergency fixes

## Monitoring

- Firebase Analytics for user metrics
- Firebase Crashlytics for error reporting
- Custom application logging for detailed debugging
