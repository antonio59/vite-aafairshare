# GitHub and Deployment Strategy

## Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production branch, deployed to production environment
- `feature/*` - Feature branches, created from `main`
- `hotfix/*` - Hotfix branches, created from `main`

## Workflow

1. Development work happens on `feature/*` branches
2. Feature branches are merged into `main` via PR
3. `main` is automatically deployed to production
4. For emergency fixes, create a `hotfix/*` branch from `main`

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Workflows

- **Pull Request Validation**: Runs on all PRs to validate code quality
- **Production Deployment**: Runs on pushes to `main` and deploys to production

### Environment Setup

**Production Environment**:
- Supabase project: `<your-supabase-project>`
- Netlify site: `<your-netlify-site>`
- Custom domain: `aafairshare.com`
- Strict security rules

## Version Management

- Dependencies are locked in package.json with exact versions
- Major dependency updates require dedicated PRs and testing
- Semantic versioning for application releases (vX.Y.Z)
  - X: Major version (breaking changes)
  - Y: Minor version (new features)
  - Z: Patch version (bug fixes)

## Secrets Management

GitHub Secrets are used to store:
- Supabase service keys
- API keys
- Environment-specific configuration

## Deployment Process

Each deployment includes:
- Build process with environment-specific variables
- Netlify deployment
- GitHub Release creation (for production)
- Slack notifications

## Rollback Strategy

1. In case of deployment issues, use Netlify's rollback feature
2. For database issues, restore from the latest backup
3. Create a hotfix branch from `main` for emergency fixes

## Monitoring

- Supabase logs and analytics for user metrics
- Custom application logging for detailed debugging
