# Code Quality & Architecture Assessment

## Current Architecture Overview
- **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript and Vite
- **State Management**: React Context + React Query
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Routing**: React Router v7

## Code Issues & Improvement Plan

### 1. Component Size & Complexity
- **Issue**: Oversized components (ExpenseForm.tsx: 558 lines, Dashboard.tsx: 790 lines)
- **Solution**: Break down into smaller, focused components
  - [x] Extract form sections in ExpenseForm
  - [x] Split Dashboard into logical sections
  - [x] Create container/presentation component pattern

### 2. Data Flow & State Management
- **Issue**: AuthContext handles too many responsibilities
- **Solution**: Domain-specific contexts
  - [x] Split into UserContext, ResourceContext
  - [x] Create dedicated hooks for resource operations
  - [x] Standardize loading state management

### 3. Type Definitions & Consistency
- **Issue**: Duplicate user type definitions, inconsistent interfaces
- **Solution**: Centralize type system
  - [x] Create shared type library
  - [x] Eliminate inline type definitions
  - [x] Standardize types across components
  - [x] Align User types between Supabase model and application model
  - [x] Resolve split type inconsistencies (e.g., "Equal"/"50/50" vs "Owned"/"100%")

### 4. Error Handling
- **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling throughout codebase
- **Solution**: Standardized error management
  - [x] Create global error handling system
  - [x] Add proper error boundaries
  - [x] Implement retry mechanisms for network operations

### 5. Code Duplication
- **Issue**: Repetitive database query logic across components
- **Solution**: Abstract into reusable services
  - [x] Create service modules for Supabase operations
  - [x] Implement repository pattern for data access
  - [x] Centralize query logic in custom hooks

### 6. Performance Optimization
- **Issue**: Potential performance issues with large data sets
- **Solution**: Implement optimizations
  - [x] Add React.memo for expensive components
  - [x] Optimize expensive calculations in useMemo/useCallback

### 7. Code Style & Documentation
- **Issue**: Inconsistent naming, minimal documentation
- **Solution**: Standardize conventions
  - [x] Add JSDoc comments to public interfaces
  - [x] Standardize file and component naming
  - [x] Create consistent code formatting

### 8. Testing Coverage
- **Issue**: Limited evidence of testing
- **Solution**: Comprehensive test strategy
  - [x] Add unit tests for business logic
  - [x] Implement component testing
  - [ ] Add E2E testing for critical flows

### 9. Authentication Service
- **Issue**: Authentication tightly coupled to Google sign-in implementation
- **Solution**: Abstract authentication providers
  - [x] Create provider-agnostic auth interface
  - [x] Implement Google authentication
  - [x] Standardize user profile data structure
  - [x] Add comprehensive session management

### 10. Supabase Integration
- **Issue**: Direct Supabase references throughout the codebase
- **Solution**: Proper abstraction layer
  - [x] Create service modules for Supabase operations
  - [x] Add data transformation layer between database and application models
  - [x] Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data
  - [x] Add offline support capabilities

## Architectural Decisions

### Two-User System
The application is designed as a two-user expense sharing platform, which simplifies many aspects of the implementation:
- User management is streamlined for the specific use case
- Split types are limited to basic scenarios (50/50 and 100%)
- Settlement calculations are straightforward between two parties

### Supabase Integration
Supabase provides a comprehensive solution for this application:
- PostgreSQL handles the relational data model effectively
- Multiple authentication providers including Google Authentication
- Real-time capabilities enable synchronization between users
- Serverless architecture eliminates need for custom backend

### Component Lazy Loading
The application uses a lazy loading pattern for complex components:
- Improves initial load time by deferring non-critical components
- Allows better code splitting and bundle optimization
- Components like LazyExpenseForm and LazyExpenseTable demonstrate this pattern

### Query Caching Strategy
React Query implementation provides smart data handling:
- Automatic refetching on component remount
- Configurable stale times for optimizing network requests
- Background refetching for data freshness
- Error handling with retry logic

### Type System Architecture
The application now uses a centralized type system:
- Shared types are defined in `shared/types.ts`
- Common conversion functions for transforming between different type systems
- Consistent enums for values like SplitType
- Proper JSDoc comments for improved developer experience
