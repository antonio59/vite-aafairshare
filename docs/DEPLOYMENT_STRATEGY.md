# Deployment Strategy

This document outlines our deployment strategy for the Firebase application, including environment management, versioning, and deployment procedures.

## Environments

| Environment | Firebase Project | Purpose | Branch | URL | Access |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Development | fairshare-dev | Local development | Any | localhost | Developers |
| Staging | fairshare-staging | Pre-production testing | develop | staging.fairshare.app | Team, QA, Stakeholders |
| Production | fairshare-prod | Live application | main | fairshare.app | Public |

## Firebase Configuration

### Multiple Projects Setup

We use separate Firebase projects for each environment to ensure complete isolation:

1. **Development**: Local development using Firebase emulators
2. **Staging**: Testing environment for QA and pre-production validation
3. **Production**: Live environment for end users

### Environment Configuration

Environment-specific configuration is managed through:

1. `.env` files for local development
2. Firebase Functions environment variables for deployed environments
3. Firebase Remote Config for dynamic configuration

Example `.env.local` structure:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxx
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxx
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=xxx
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=xxx
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=xxx
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=xxx
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=xxx
```

## Deployment Process

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment using GitHub Actions:

1. **PR Validation**: Run tests and checks for all pull requests
2. **Staging Deployment**: Automatically deploy to staging when changes are merged to `develop`
3. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production when changes are merged to `main`

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build**:
   - Generate optimized production build
   - Apply environment-specific configuration

2. **Test**:
   - Run automated tests
   - Verify build integrity

3. **Deploy**:
   - Upload build to Firebase Hosting
   - Deploy Firebase Functions (if applicable)
   - Update Firestore security rules and indexes
   - Deploy Firebase Storage rules

4. **Post-deployment Verification**:
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify critical paths
   - Monitor error reporting

## Release Management

### Versioning

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- **Major version** (X.0.0): Incompatible API changes
- **Minor version** (0.X.0): New functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch version** (0.0.X): Backward-compatible bug fixes

Version numbers are maintained in:
- `package.json`
- Git tags
- Release notes

### Release Process

1. **Prepare Release**:
   - Create a release branch from `develop`
   - Update version numbers
   - Generate release notes

2. **Test Release**:
   - Deploy to staging
   - Perform regression testing
   - Fix any critical issues

3. **Finalize Release**:
   - Merge release branch to `main`
   - Tag the release in Git
   - Deploy to production

4. **Post-Release**:
   - Monitor application health
   - Collect user feedback
   - Plan next iteration

## Rollback Procedure

In case of critical issues in production:

1. **Identify Issue**:
   - Monitor error reports
   - Assess severity and impact

2. **Decision**:
   - Determine if a rollback is necessary
   - Communicate with stakeholders

3. **Rollback**:
   - Redeploy the previous stable version
   - Or deploy a hotfix directly to `main`

4. **Post-Rollback**:
   - Analyze root cause
   - Develop permanent fix
   - Update test coverage

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Firebase Performance Monitoring for application performance
- Firebase Crashlytics for error reporting
- Firebase Analytics for user behavior
- Custom Slack/email alerts for critical issues
