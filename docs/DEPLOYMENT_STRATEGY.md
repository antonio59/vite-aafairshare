# Deployment Strategy

This document outlines our deployment strategy for the application, including environment management, versioning, and deployment procedures.

## Environment

| Environment | Platform | Purpose | Branch | URL | Access |
|-------------|----------|---------|--------|-----|-------|
| Production  | Supabase/Netlify | Live application | main | aafairshare.com | Public |

## Supabase/Netlify Configuration

- All configuration is managed through `.env` files and Netlify environment variables.
- Only a production environment is maintained.

Example `.env.local` structure:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=xxx
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=xxx
```

## Deployment Process

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our CI/CD pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment using GitHub Actions:

1. **PR Validation**: Run tests and checks for all pull requests
2. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production when changes are merged to `main`

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build**:
   - Generate optimized production build
   - Apply environment-specific configuration

2. **Test**:
   - Run automated tests
   - Verify build integrity

3. **Deploy**:
   - Upload build to Netlify
   - Apply Supabase migrations (if any)

4. **Post-deployment Verification**:
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify critical paths
   - Monitor error reporting

## Release Management

### Versioning

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- **Major version** (X.0.0): Incompatible API changes
- **Minor version** (0.X.0): New functionality in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch version** (0.0.X): Backward-compatible bug fixes

Version numbers are maintained in:
- `package.json`
- Git tags
- Release notes

### Release Process

1. **Prepare Release**:
   - Create a release branch from `main`
   - Update version numbers
   - Generate release notes

2. **Test Release**:
   - Deploy to production preview (if available)
   - Perform regression testing
   - Fix any critical issues

3. **Finalize Release**:
   - Merge release branch to `main`
   - Tag the release in Git
   - Deploy to production

4. **Post-Release**:
   - Monitor application health
   - Collect user feedback
   - Plan next iteration

## Rollback Procedure

In case of critical issues in production:

1. **Identify Issue**:
   - Monitor error reports
   - Assess severity and impact

2. **Decision**:
   - Determine if a rollback is necessary
   - Communicate with stakeholders

3. **Rollback**:
   - Redeploy the previous stable version via Netlify
   - Or deploy a hotfix directly to `main`

4. **Post-Rollback**:
   - Analyze root cause
   - Develop permanent fix
   - Update test coverage

## Monitoring and Alerting

- Supabase logs and analytics for application performance and user behavior
- Custom Slack/email alerts for critical issues
